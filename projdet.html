        Increasing use of internet, online business platforms are becoming of the largest market place of-     
        the world . Purchase of online product is heavily dependent on user reviews .   Some dishonest the
        groups of people misuse this fact by posting onfake reviews to promote their own products or demote
        their competitor.Detection of fake online reviews can be considered as binary  classification task 
        that models a classifier to tell whether a review is fake or true.In this paper, we have developed 
        an effective supervised machine learning approach to classify fake online  reviews using a dataset
        that contains hotel reviews from online websites . . .</font>
